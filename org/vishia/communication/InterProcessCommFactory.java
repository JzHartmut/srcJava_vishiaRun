/**This class is used as interface and as singleton instance access for factory of any InterProcessComm.
 * An derived instance of this class which offers all necessary types of InterProcessComm should be created
 * on start of an application. See {@link InterProcessCommFactorySocket}. For example: 
 * <pre>
 *   new InterProcessCommFactorySocket();  //creates a singleton.
 * </pre>
 * This instance can be used with the following pattern: 
 * <pre>
 *   InterProcessCommFactory.singeton().create("UDP:127.0.0.1:60100");
 * </pre>
 * This example creates an InterProcessComm instance which uses an Socket-UDP-Protocoll on port 60100 on local host (loop back).
 * <br><br>
 * A further instance can be created, for example for test reasons. Then an association need to be set:
 * <pre>
 *   InterProcessCommFactory ipcFactory = new InterProcessCommFactorySocket();  //creates a singleton.
 *   .....
 *   ipcFactory.create("UDP:127.0.0.1:60105");
 * </pre>
